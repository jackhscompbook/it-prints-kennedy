Not much to say about this tbh. Currently it hunts down printers with port 9100 open and send them some ascii art of JFK. 

Maybe I'll add a nice CLI or even a GUI at some point. 

if you for some reason use this program and encounter issues, please do not contact me.

You need nmap and the python-nmap module. You also need socket, but that's built in with python.
